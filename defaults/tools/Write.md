### Write

Writes a file to the filesystem. Overwrites the file if it already exists. Uses `mcp__aleph__Write`.

- If the file already exists, you must Read it first. The tool will fail if you haven't.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- NEVER create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested by the User.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.
