    description: First smoke test (restricted tools)
    status: done
    notes: >
      Ran successfully. Aleph connected, read her memory and registry to orient,
      wrote hello.md. Several issues discovered — see below.

  - id: 8
    description: Fix tool schema visibility (allowed_tools vs tools)
    status: done
    notes: >
      RESOLVED: allowed_tools (--allowedTools) only gates execution, not schema
      visibility. The model still saw all 18 CC built-in tool schemas. Fix: use the
      tools parameter (--tools) to control which tool schemas the model receives.
      Set tools=BASE_TOOLS in harness. Now Aleph sees only our 6 tools + MCP tools.
      Residual: CC's Bash tool description internally references Glob/Grep/TodoWrite
      — baked into CC's schema text, can't control. Minor noise, model handles it fine.

  - id: 9
    description: Fix duplicate text output (StreamEvent + AssistantMessage)
    status: done
    notes: >
      Fixed in TUI: _handle_sdk_message renders text only from StreamEvent deltas.
      AssistantMessage text is explicitly skipped (comment: "Text content is a
      duplicate of stream events -- skip it"), and only ToolUseBlocks are extracted
      from AssistantMessage.

  - id: 10
    description: Fix nested session detection (CLAUDECODE env var)
    status: done
    notes: >
      SDK refuses to launch inside a Claude Code session. Fixed by unsetting
      CLAUDECODE env var in harness.py at module load.

  - id: 11
    description: Address hallucinated tools/skills in system prompt
    status: done
    notes: >
      RESOLVED: Root cause was missing `tools` parameter (see task 8). CC was passing
      all 18 built-in tool schemas regardless of allowed_tools. Fix: set tools=BASE_TOOLS.
      Parent session skills (keybindings-help) leaked via <system-reminder> tags injected
      into user messages by CC runtime — these are gone now that we control the tool set.
      CC prepends "You are a Claude agent, built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK." before
      our system prompt — minor, not worth fighting. --setting-sources "" correctly
      prevents CLAUDE.md loading.
